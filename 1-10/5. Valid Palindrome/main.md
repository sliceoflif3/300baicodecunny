I make a clean function, that remove white space, nonalphabetical characters, and convert all characters to lowercase. Then, I run from the first letter of string to the middle character, and compare its counterpart (the last letter, the second last letter, etc.) with the current letter. If any of the comparison is false, I return false. If all the comparison is true, I return true.
